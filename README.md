# Quest1
Creation of a character and some choices

## Origin
This is a Storyline sample I created as a proof of concept of saving a game file containing choices made by the user. This includes name of the avatar, its look, the selection of a backpack, its content, some questions peferences, and a narrative choice.

There is a Quest 2 course that is aimed to load the save file and read its content and adjust the course based on these choices. Including the consequence of a narrative choice.
